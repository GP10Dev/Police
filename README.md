How it works?
 > A police officer logs in
 > Logged in officer can record new crime
 > on recording this, the system responds with a case reference of the newly reported case.
 > if any suspects option is active, the system redirects to the suspects page.
 > new suspects can be attached to the same case...
 > by default, the logged in user is assigned to the case
 > any officer can add the exhibits
 > a single case can have many exhibits
